# amazon-clone-using-html-and-css
 An Amazon clone using HTML and CSS is a static replica of Amazon's e-commerce site, emulating its layout and design. It replicates the homepage, product listings, and product detail pages, focusing on front-end structure without backend features like payment or user authentication. Ideal for practice!
